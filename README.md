# Navid_mowito_assignment

I have attached both files....  **Note: working codes are rrt_base.py and rrt_main.py**


1. rrt_planning.py **(Not working code** ....tried with Rviz by subscribing to topics map and move_base/simple Goal.)

**2. rr_base.py and rrt_main.py  (Working)**





**Running the code:**

1. run the rrt_main.py (in this we can define number of obstacle and size of obstacle algorithm randomly generates obstacles)
   we can change start point goal and obstacle numbers in the same script
     
     

I worked with python + ROS, and navigation system in Doozy robotics chennai, I programmed multi point navigation (python script) using default amcl node. i have been learning and exploring ROS since 2 years (i m at intermediate level) But i can understand the code written in C++ as i have started working with C++


Thank you for giving me this assignment, I never worked with path planning algorithm before, but just used amcl node and finished my work, this time 
I understood backend of the algorithm and tried to implement with ROS RVIZ, 

But i failed,  i was unable  to draw that in rviz. After that i tried with simple python and successfully implemented till calculating the equidistance between "random point generated" with "the available nodes" from the tree. but i didn't understand how to keep record of parent child information...

After that i went through several blogs , websites, youtube and i took some reference and i finally i implemented the algorithm.... **(I have attached a image of my calculation "snapCapture.jpg" snapCapture.jpg

)**

Now I know how to implement such algorithms... but before going to the blogs I tried and only I stuck at recording the parent child info...

I have implemented the algorithm with taking some reference from the available sources
