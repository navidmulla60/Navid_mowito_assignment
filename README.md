# RRt_python

I have attached both files....  **Note: working codes are rrt_base.py and rrt_main.py**


1. rrt_planning.py **(Not working code** ....tried with Rviz by subscribing to topics map and move_base/simple Goal.)

**2. rr_base.py and rrt_main.py  (Working)**





**Running the code:**

1. run the **rrt_main.py** (in this we can define number of obstacle and size of obstacle algorithm randomly generates obstacles)
   we can change start point goal and obstacle numbers in the same script
     
     


I have implemented the algorithm with taking some reference from the available sources
