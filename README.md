# RRt_python

**Running the code:**

1. run the **rrt_main.py** (in this we can define number of obstacle and size of obstacle algorithm randomly generates obstacles)
   we can change start point goal and obstacle numbers in the same script
     
     


I have implemented the algorithm with taking some reference from the available sources
